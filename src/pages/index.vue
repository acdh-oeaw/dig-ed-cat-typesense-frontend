          <b>Why?</b>&emsp; Since 2012 the Catalogue of Digital Editions has
          been gathering digital editions and texts in an attempt to survey and
          identify best practice in the field of digital scholarly editing.
          Analogous initiatives exist but don't provide the granular analysis of
          features necessary to better understand the rationale and methodology
          behind the creation of a digital edition. This Catalogue provides an
          accessible record of standards and building technologies used, and
          thus an insight into past and present projects.

          <b>How?</b>&emsp; Development on this web application began in 2016
          and aims at delivering the Catalogue data in an interactive and
          user-friendly manner, allowing users to browse, search, filter and
          order projects around their research interests.

          <b>What?</b>&emsp; The Catalogue continuously adds digital editions
          and always seeks external contributions. For instructions on how to
          submit a digital edition to the Catalogue, please visit the
          Documentation page of this site. Projects added will be exposed to
          over 300 German libraries thanks to the Catalogue's integration into
          the German Library Network (DBIS).
