					Why? &emsp; Since 2012 the Catalogue of Digital Editions has been gathering digital
					editions and texts in an attempt to survey and identify best practice in the field of
					digital scholarly editing. Analogous initiatives exist but don't provide the granular
					analysis of features necessary to better understand the rationale and methodology behind
					the creation of a digital edition. This Catalogue provides an accessible record of
					standards and building technologies used, and thus an insight into past and present
					projects.
				</div>
				<div class="p-4">
					How? &emsp; Development on this web application began in 2016 and aims at delivering the
					Catalogue data in an interactive and user-friendly manner, allowing users to browse,
					search, filter and order projects around their research interests.
				</div>
				<div class="p-4">
					What? &emsp; The Catalogue continuously adds digital editions and always seeks external
					contributions. For instructions on how to submit a digital edition to the Catalogue,
					please visit the Documentation page of this site. Projects added will be exposed to over
					300 German libraries thanks to the Catalogue's integration into the German Library Network
					(DBIS).
