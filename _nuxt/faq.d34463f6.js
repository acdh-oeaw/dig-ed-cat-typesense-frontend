What are the criteria for inclusion in the <em class="italic">Catalogue?</em></strong></p><p class="mb-3"> The project is constantly evolving as users request more features and development on the app moves forward. At the moment we don&#39;t accept ebooks, any form of commercial digital books or transcriptions made available via Wikisource, but projects whose authorship can be traced back to one or multiple individuals with, if possible, an institutional affiliation (university and/or GLAM institution). We primarily look for digital editions and digital <em class="italic">scholarly</em> editions (by which we mean editions with a strong critical component) but people are also beginning to submit digital archives, textual collections where some texts are treated in more detail, etc. It&#39;s worth noting that people define their projects in various ways (e.g. a project may define itself as a database when it fact it might be more of a digital archive) using different terms synonymously. This makes it difficult to pick what should be included in our list or not. The line of inclusion in our catalogue is a little blurry but it reflects the fuzziness that comes with these projects. </p>',3),b={class:"mb-3"},g=a('<p class="mb-3"><strong class="text-bold"> Q.
