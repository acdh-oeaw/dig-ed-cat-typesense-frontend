While there are cross-publisher directories of digital publications like AAUP's aforementioned Directory of Digital Publishing Projects, and the independent Directory of Open Access Journals (https://doaj.org) that can cover a great scope of subject matter, these directories and the individual reviews and review publications offer little in the way of comparisons of the type that might help us better understand the field and evaluate its trends. One notable exception to this is the Catalogue of Digital Editions, by Greta Franzini (https://dig-ed-cat.eos.arz.oeaw.ac.at/), who defines "digital edition" for these purposes as a critical edition that is not merely a facsimile edition, but one that takes advantage of its digital space and that fully "represents its material (usually as transcribed/edited text)" (Franzini). Though limited to its own particular subset of digital publishing activity, Franzini's Catalogue comprises a dataset of some 230 digital editions, currently, with some fifty consistent and comparable pieces of data on each, that range from the edition's subject matter and URL, to its features, textual encoding scheme, and technological infrastructure. While it takes a more object, data-focused approach to reviewing and cataloguing the included editions, the Catalogue also uniquely offers the possibility of rich comparison and analysis across publications, even if that more subjective and evaluative work is yet to be done. It may also someday provide a model to be applied to the evaluation of other types of digital publishing projects, specifically like the Mellon-funded university press projects, the Getty's OSCI collaborative, and other open access, scholarly editions which have been the subject of our history here thus far. `,-1),v=e("footer",{class:"p-2"},[e("cite",null,"Greg Albers"),t(" - April 2017, "),e("a",{href:"https://mw17.mwconf.org/paper/the-next-generation-of-online-publishing-building-on-what-weve-learned-together/",title:"Opens in new tab",target:"_blank"}," article ")],-1),w=e("p",null,"What a nifty resource and cool website!",-1),k=e("footer",{class:"p-2"},[e("cite",null,"Ron van den Branden"),t(" - March 2017, email ")],-1),x=e("p",null," Discussing @GretaFranzini’s catalogue of digital editions [...] #dixit Great resource, in addition to @patrick_sahle’s!
