Analogous initiatives exist but don&#39;t provide the granular analysis of features necessary to better understand the rationale and methodology behind the creation of a digital edition. This Catalogue provides an accessible record of standards and building technologies used, and thus an insight into past and present projects. </div><div class="p-4"><b>How?</b>  Development on this web application began in 2016 and aims at delivering the Catalogue data in an interactive and user-friendly manner, allowing users to browse, search, filter and order projects around their research interests. </div><div class="p-4"><b>What?</b>  The Catalogue continuously adds digital editions and always seeks external contributions. For instructions on how to submit a digital edition to the Catalogue, please visit the Documentation page of this site. Projects added will be exposed to over 300 German libraries thanks to the Catalogue&#39;s integration into the German Library Network (DBIS). </div></div></div>',1),r=[d];function l(c,g){return i(),t("div",o,r)}const u=e(n,[["render",l]]);export{u as default};
